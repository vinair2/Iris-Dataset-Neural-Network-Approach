# Iris-Dataset-Neural-Network-Approach

The Iris Flowers dataset is a well-known dataset consisting of three varieties of Iris flowers: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. The dataset includes a total of 150 Iris flowers, 50 for each variety, and includes sepal and petal dimensions.
This repository consists of analysis of the Iris Flowers Data and a neural network classifier model.

## Jupyter Notebooks:
### IrisDatasetAnalysis.ipynb
This notebook consists of an analysis of Iris Flowers Dataset utilizing SQLite and SQL queries for data management and retrieval. This notebook includes several visualizations and plots that were created using Matplotlib and Seaborn which highlights descriptive statistics.


### IrisFlowersNeuralNetworkClassification.ipynb
The IrisFlowersNeuralNetworkClassification.ipynb short project consists of a classification model utilizing a neural network. The neural network is built with Kerasâ€™ sequential model with the Adam optimization algorithm. Additionally, there are plots for both training loss and accuracy to benchmark the model over the span of 20 epochs, and a visualization of the predictions made by the model on the test data split.
